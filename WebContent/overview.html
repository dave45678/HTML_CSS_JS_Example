<p>Three languages all web developers must learn:</p>
<ol>
   <li>HTML to define the content of web pages</li>
   <li>CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
   <li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
</ol>




A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

CSS selector

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
